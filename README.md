# DatasetMD

DatasetMD is a Python library for handling (spatial) metadata for (scientific / environmental) datasets.

DatasetMD is inspired by the `iso` module of `OWSLib <https://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/>`_. However, while `iso` is
focussed on the data model of the ISO19115 standard for geospatial metadata DatasetMD is designed for more general
dataset metadata descriptions. DatasetMD has been developed to give support to the ISO19115 standard, specifically
through compliance with the metadata profile for the European Commission's INSPIRE spatial data infrastructure. Support
will also provided for other relevant dataset metadata profiles, such as DataCite's metadata schema and Schema.org.

Please read the documentation at _foo_ for more information.
